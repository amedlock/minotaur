TREASURE OF TARMIN* CARTRIDGE
Cartridge Instructions
(For 1 Player)

*ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and TREASURE OF TARMIN are 
trademarks owned by and used under license from TSR Hobbies, Inc.

The DREADED MINOTAUR and his monster companions built a 
complicated system of MAZES and DUNGEONS in the island of Tarmin 
to hide and protect the Great Treasure of dark ages. Along with other 
stolen riches, they took OBJECTS of SPIRITUAL POWERS and LETHAL 
WEAPONS. Now the castle with its GHASTLY OCCUPANTS and 
FIERCELY GUARDED TREASURES has lured you in...You begin your 
JOURNEY wondering whether you'll ever make it to the end...

OBJECT OF THE GAME
ALONE in a deep web of endless rooms and corridors...you move on 
with a bow, a quiver of arrows, a sack of flour, and an empty pack 
toward DEEPER PATHWAYS...beyond which the TARMIN TREASURE 
can be found. Yet you know the DEVOURING MINOTAUR awaits 
you...at the end of your quest. You proceed cautiously through ILL-
OMENED GATES and LADDERS and even HIDDEN DOORS. You bump 
into all kinds of combat and spiritual objects, some of which give you 
STRANGE POWERS when collected and then used. Your pack can only 
contain up to 6 objects, your hand 2 -- but they can be swapped 
around and used in the best possible ways. So it's up to you to 
OUTSMART the EVIL FORCES...and GRAB the LOOT!

THE SCREEN
The screen displays either the CASTLE MAP, showing a side view of 
the maze beneath the castle, or the MAZE MAP, showing your point 
of view as you move through the maze.

At the bottom of both screens is a collection of objects and 
information:

At the center bottom is the MAZE LEVEL NUMBER, showing the level 
you are on (1 to 256).

Above the Level Number is the OBJECT AT YOUR FEET (Maze Map 
only)

To the left of the Level Number is the OBJECT IN LEFT HAND.

To the right of the Level Number is the OBJECT IN RIGHT HAND.

To the left of the Object in Left Hand is the COMPASS, represented by 
a letter (N, W, S, E) that shows the direction you are facing (North, 
West, South, East).

Around the Compass are the items currently in your PACK. There can 
be from none to four items in the Pack.

To the right of the Object in Right Hand is the 3-WAY SCORE: three 
sets of numbers separated by slashes. The top set is your 
WAR/SPIRITUAL STRENGTH SCORE. The middle set is your 
ARMOR/RING DEFENSES SCORE. The bottom set is your WAR 
WEAPON/SPIRITUAL WEAPON SCORE.

Above the 3-Way Score is your TREASURE SCORE (Castle Map only).


YOUR COMMANDS

* To LOOK at CASTLE MAP, press and hold either Upper Action 
Button. The FLASHING WHITE DOT will tell you where you are -- 
level and location -- in the maze system. Up to 12 levels can be seen 
on the map. The SMALL YELLOW CHEST in the center of the lowest 
level indicates the location of the TARMIN TREASURE...guarded by 
the MINOTAUR. This is the first of 256 levels where the treasure can 
be found. Each level down is filled with nastier monsters and magic 
items...and maybe the terrible Minotaur! You CANNOT look at the 
castle map while fighting a monster!

* To MOVE FORWARD, TURN LEFT, or TURN RIGHT, press and hold 
DISC in corresponding position.

* TO COUNT number of FOOD UNITS you have, press and hold Lower 
Left Action Button. You'll hear a series of CLICKS. Each click 
corresponds to a food unit. You can collect up to 99 units of food by 
picking up flour sacks of 6 to 9 units each.

* To COUNT number of ARROWS you have, press and hold Lower 
Right Action Button. You'll hear a series of CLICKS. Each click 
corresponds to an arrow. You can collect up to 99 arrows by picking 
up quivers of 6 to 9 arrows each.

* To pick up or drop objects, press PICK UP/DROP (1). This relates to 
your RIGHT HAND only. Your hand must be empty to pick up 
something, otherwise this command will swap what is in your hand 
with what is at your feet.

* To swap objects from one hand to another, press SWAP HANDS (2).

* To rotate objects in your pack, press ROTATE PACK (3). Up to 6 
objects will rotate in a CLOCKWISE direction, one position at a time, 
occupying the following clock positions: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock.

* To swap an object in your pack with an object in your right hand, 
press SWAP PACK (6). You can only swap an object occupying the 3 
o'clock position in your pack.

* TO open an UNLOCKED CONTAINER at your feet, or a door or hidden 
door directly in front of you, press OPEN (4). Certain walls may 
contain a HIDDEN DOOR. If TRAPPED in a room, try this command 
when facing a wall.

* To use an object in your right hand, or possibly act upon an object 
at your feet, press USE (5).

* To attack a monster directly in front of you with the object in your 
right hand, press ATTACK (7). You cannot attack while the objects in 
your left and right hands are flashing (this means it's NOT your turn). 
Monsters often attack first. Wait for your turn.

* To REGAIN both your WAR STRENGTH and SPIRITUAL STRENGTH 
after a battle, press REST (8). The amount of rest you'll get will 
depend on the number of food units you have picked up. Each unit of 
food can give you up to 5 units of war strength and 2 units of 
spiritual strength.

* To GO DOWN a LEVEL into a new maze using the ladder at your feet, 
press USE LADDER (9). Once used, a ladder WON'T allow you to CLIMB 
UP a level again. However, when you reach level 256, the deepest 
one, a ladder will place you back up to level 1.

* To see what is to your left, press GLANCE LEFT (CLEAR).

* TO see what is to your right, press GLANCE RIGHT (ENTER).

* To go back where you were last or retrace your last step, press 
RETREAT/RETRACE (0). Press once to retreat and the monster will 
take one LAST SHOT at you. If you continue pressing this command, 
the monster will continue hitting you until you let up on the Disc.

GET READY
Start by setting the skill level:

Press 3 for Easiest
Press 2 for Easy
Press 1 for Medium
Press DISC for Hard

START YOUR JOURNEY!
Once a skill level has been set, the game begins immediately with a 
brief display of the overall CASTLE MAP.

The castle map comes and goes. You've been told where you are in 
the first maze level, by the FLASHING WHITE DOT. You've seen the 
ladders diagonally connecting the maze levels, and the TARMIN 
TREASURE (represented by a small YELLOW CHEST) right in the 
middle of the bottom level!

Here are your INITIAL CONDITIONS, depending on your skill level 
chosen:

EASIEST
Minimum Maze Levels: 2
Possible Length of Game: 5 to 30 minutes
Your Vulnerability: 1/4
Your War/Spiritual Strength: 18/9
Your Food: 9
Your Arrows: 9

EASY
Minimum Maze Levels: 4
Possible Length of Game: 1/4 to 1 hour
Your Vulnerability: 1/2
Your War/Spiritual Strength: 16/8
Your Food: 8
Your Arrows: 8

MEDIUM
Minimum Maze Levels: 8
Possible Length of Game: 1/2 to 3 hours
Your Vulnerability: 3/4
Your War/Spiritual Strength: 14/7
Your Food: 7
Your Arrows: 7

HARD
Minimum Maze Levels: 12
Possible Length of Game: 1.5 to 5 hours
Your Vulnerability: FULL
Your War/Spiritual Strength: 12/6
Your Food: 6
Your Arrows: 6

Now you're on your own in the NW corner of the maze...heading 
EAST...inside an outer corridor. You carry a BOW in your right hand, 
some ARROWS in the quiver, a little FOOD in a sack, and an empty 
pack. Neither the quiver nor the sack are seen. The pack occupies the 
area on the screen where the COMPASS is, and is noticed only when 
stuffed with objects. Move in the direction you want to go, by 
pressing edge of DISC.

Often, EYEBALL MURALS will appear to you. They are always in the 
outer corridors, MARKING the ENTRANCE to the interior of a maze. 
They come in three different colors. DARK GREEN indicates a war 
type maze, BLUE a spiritual type maze, and TAN a mixed type maze.

KNOW THE MAZE
Check your direction with the COMPASS. Look for OBJECTS and 
DOORS. Objects can be anything...such as weapons, containers, keys, 
useful items or treasures. Doors are usually easy to spot. But...

If TRAPPED in a DUNGEON, a HALLWAY, or a SECTION of the MAZE 
which seems to repeat itself endlessly, look for possible HIDDEN 
DOORS. Confront any suspicious wall as you would confront a regular 
door and press OPEN (4). If a hidden door exists, it will open. If not, 
turn around...step by step...and try other walls...or other pathways. 
Beware of OTHER DOORS...endowed with weird powers...

A LADDER in your way will provide a quick exit, DOWN into a DEEPER 
LEVEL. Approach the ladder and press USE LADDER (9). A suction 
sound will immediately transfer you! You may want to check your 
new position on the castle map, if you're still displayed on it.

Sometimes you will encounter GATES in hallways. Going through a 
gate moves you over to an adjacent maze, but it may JUMBLE your 
WAR/SPIRITUAL strength SCORE. And you CANNOT go back through 
it! (REST AFTERWARD to regain some points and check your new 
score.) Gates come in 3 colors: GREEN (makes you more war-like), 
BLUE (makes you more spiritual), and TAN (won't change you at all).

TREASURES DISAPPEAR when picked up, because you either carry 
them in your pockets or wear them. THEIR VALUES are recorded 
only on the castle map, in BLACK, directly above the 3-way scoring 
display.

QUIVERS and SACKS of FLOUR also DISAPPEAR when picked up. 
You'll be carrying them on your back!

Other objects, like USEFUL ITEMS, may DISAPPEAR when picked up 
or used with your right hand. Or they may make you 
disappear...making you INVISIBLE to all monsters but the Minotaur 
(while also making the monsters invisible to you!) Such objects have 
SPIRITUAL POWERS.

To use a spiritual object, and it must be in your right hand or at your 
feet, press USE (5). Use immediately -- rather than keeping it around 
-- to build up your spiritual power, increase your score, and stand 
better chances of SURVIVING ATTACKING MONSTERS. Check spiritual 
points, if any, right of the slash of any of the three displayed scores.

ATTACKING!
You must have a weapon or magical item for use in your RIGHT 
HAND to fight. If you don't, swap a weapon from your left hand or 
pack. Or pick up a weapon that you find. Try to be prepared with a 
shield in your left hand. If order of objects in pack needs rotating, do 
so, and get your most effective weapon out!

Remember, many weapons and items will VANISH upon their use in 
battle. So keep several weapons in your pack to ensure victory. 
Watch both YOUR SCORE and the MONSTER'S SCORE before and after 
every round of attack. Work out a BATTLE STRATEGY. Some 
monsters will knock you out with just one or two blows...if you're not 
careful!

Avoid attacking if your score looks weaker than the monster's. Press 
RETREAT/RETRACE and move away. Chances are you can PICK UP 
MORE WEAPONS in the hallways and dungeons and ATTACK LATER!

You can only attack a monster STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT of you, 
although a monster may attack you from a nearby position. 
Sometimes he might just run smack in front of you from BEHIND a 
DOOR that behaves strangely because of an OMINOUS SPELL. Watch 
out for those SURPRISE ATTACKS!

After the initial assault, you ALTERNATE ATTACKS. If you attack first 
, you CANNOT attack again until the monster has thrown something 
at you. The exchange will be brief if either you or the monster is 
much stronger. Or it may last quite a while if there is a balance of 
forces.

The BATTLE ENDS when either you or the monster DIES...or when you 
RETREAT. Monsters NEVER retreat. A dying monster will disappear in 
a cloud of smoke. His score will vanish too. If you DIE, your score will 
end up with a 0 on either side of the slash of your WAR/SPIRITUAL 
STRENGTH scoring display. However, cheer up! If you are worthy, 
you'll be REINCARNATED! And that means, a new opportunity for you 
to win!

SCORING
Your 3-WAY SCORING DISPLAY on BOTH MAPS plus your SPECIAL 
TREASURE VALUE SCORING DISPLAY on the CASTLE MAP tell you 
how you're doing. Anything LEFT of a slash on the 3-way scoring is a 
WAR-TYPE score, anything RIGHT of a slash is a SPIRITUAL score.

At the BOTTOM is the score of the object (WAR WEAPON or 
SPIRITUAL WEAPON) you have picked up for use in COMBAT...or 
BUILD YOUR STRENGTH in preparation for such a combat. The score 
will remain on the screen as long as you hold the object in your 
RIGHT HAND. In the MIDDLE is your ARMOR/RING body DEFENSES 
score. At the TOP is your overall STRENGTH (WAR and SPIRITUAL) 
score. Keep it high!

A similar overall STRENGTH score is kept for the monster attacking 
you! His comes in green or blue colors. GREEN for WAR-derived 
STRENGTH and BLUE for SPIRITUAL-derived STRENGTH. This score 
will appear DURING a BATTLE only and on the spot on the screen 
where normally the maze level indication appears. The score that 
appears initially is the weakest of his two -- WAR or SPIRITUAL. 
Thereafter, is the score that was last damaged by your weapon used.

Notice that your MAXIMUM STRENGTH score (top line) under normal 
conditions is 49/24. But using useful items such as war or spiritual 
books or certain potions may change that! Notice also that your 
MAXIMUM WEAPON score (bottom line) is 99/0 (if WAR type) or 
0/65 (if SPIRITUAL). Always check the SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE 
tables to plan your STRATEGIES...and SURVIVE! And ultimately WIN 
the GAME!

[NOTE: In the original hand-written instructions by programmer Tom 
Loughry, Tom suggests that the true gamer will have more fun by 
NOT reading the SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE section, instead learning 
the secrets for himself while playing.]
